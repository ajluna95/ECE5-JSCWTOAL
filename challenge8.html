              Our PID values increased or decreased, according to the speed. However the PID values can be calculated linearly, therefore there was no ratio that can be used across all obstacles. The PID values were calculated through trial and error, for each obstacle and speed.
              <br>
              <b><strong>Obstacle:</b></strong> The PID values the produced the best time, when running the loop obstacle are as follows, Sp:17 P:21 I:.02 D:.1 
              <br>
              <b><strong>Frequency Sweep:</b></strong> The PID values the produced the best time, when running the loop obstacle are as follows, Sp:17 P:21 I.02: D:.1

          <div class="box"> What does PID stand for?  What is the purpose of the P, the I, and the D?  
            What steps did you take to choose the best values for your robot? 
            Explain this like you would for someone taking this course next year.
          PID stands for Proportional–Integral–Derivative.
