          <div class="box"> Our chassis was designed to incorporate every functional aspect of the robot. The first photo captures the design phase of robot. The second photo captures the fully assembled robot with the completed chassis. As shown in photo two, the functionality of the chassis was taken into high consideration, during the design phase of the robot. Every component used to create the line following robot has a specific placement in our chassis, for example, both batteries has a method of securing them to avoid any complications during the movement of the robot. Furthermore, the placement of the photoresistors was designed to be adjusted vertically, if needed. Every component has some means of adjustment and securement to the chassis.   </div>
          <div class="box"> The purpose of the motorshield to assist with communication between the Arduino and the motors used to move the robot. The motorshield allows a separate power source to be used for the motors, and simplifies the communication between the Arduino and the motors by the usage of header pins. This allows specific pins the be called and addressed when coding the Arduino.  </div>
