          <br>
          The objective of the project was to implement the knowledge we have gained throughout the quarter to create a self-driving car.
          To achieve this we created multiple circuits; one including photoresistors, one with potentiometers and another with Leds.
          The photoresistors provided readings based on their surroundings, they were used to indicate whether the robot was over a white surface or black surface.
          Using the readings obtained from the photoresistors, the arudino would then calculate an error to help indicate where the black line and how the robot needed to behave.
          The error was then used to in our PID calculations, when the communicated with the motors telling them how to behave. Thus turning the robot, or increasing speed. 
          Overall, this project used almost every component we learned from previous labs, from soldering, 3D printing, building circuits, coding, and lastly communicating with teammates.
